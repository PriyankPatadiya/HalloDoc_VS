-- The "film" table has the replacement cost and rental duration (assume, in weeks)
-- for each movie.
-- Can you tell me the movies (just the title and relevant details) sorted by highest
-- to lowest replacement cost and rented out for 4-6 weeks.
-- Also I don't want all the data, just give me 100 records.

--SELECT rating , film_id , title , replacement_cost , rental_duration from film WHERE rental_duration BETWEEN 4 and 6 ORDER BY replacement_cost desc LIMIT 100

-- I want a list of all movies that either have the rating 'G' or 'PG'.
-- The movies must be longer than 120 minutes in length, and they should have the
-- word 'Action' anywhere in the description.
-- HINT:
-- Use the "film" table
-- Use LIKE keyword, for the requirement on 'Action'

--SELECT film_id , title , rating , length , description from film WHERE rating IN('G', 'PG') AND length > 120 AND description LIKE'%Action%';


-- The "actor" table has names of all actors. Can you tell me which actor first names
-- are most common and how many records have it?

--SELECT first_name , COUNT(first_name)FROM actor GROUP BY first_name HAVING COUNT(first_name) >= 3 ORDER BY count desc
